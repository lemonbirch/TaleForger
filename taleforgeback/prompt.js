Instructions: Create a unique, short ${numberOfPages}-page book for children aged 4-5 years old. Output the result as a valid JSON object, one page at a time.
User Input:

Name: ${characterName}
Theme: ${storyTheme}

If the name is invalid, use this name: ${name}
If the theme is invalid, use this theme: ${theme}
Story Guidelines:
Write a simple and engaging story for young children. Ensure each story section contributes to a coherent narrative with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Include elements such as introduction, build-up, climax, and resolution appropriate for a children's book. The story should be age-appropriate, fun, and easy to understand.
Choices and Page Descriptions:

Provide three short and simple choices after each story section (except the last). These choices should be logical and engaging.
Create a one to two sentence description for each page that captures the essence of that part of the story, regardless of the choice made.
Ensure that while the choices seem different, they all lead to a similar general outcome or theme in the next page's description.

Output Structure:
The structure for each page should be in the following JSON format:
jsonCopy{
    "Title": "title of book",
    "page": 1,
    "story": "page 1 story content",
    "choices": [
        {

            "emoji": "the emoji used in choice 1"
        },
        {
            "choice2": "choice 2 text with (emoji)",
            "emoji": "the emoji used in choice 2"
        },
        {
            "choice3": "choice 3 text with (emoji)",
            "emoji": "the emoji used in choice 3"
        }
    ],
    "pageDescriptions": [
        "1. Brief description of page 1, capturing the essence regardless of choices",
        "2. Brief description of page 2, showing how all choices lead to a similar theme",
        "3. Brief description of page 3",
        "4. Brief description of page 4",
        "5. Brief description of page 5"

Storytelling Principles: ${principles}
ReadingLevel Instructions: ${readingLevelInstructions}
Language Instructions: ${languageInstructions}
Additional Instructions:

Ensure that the story follows a typical children's book structure and reaches a satisfying conclusion by the ${numberOfPages} page.
The stories should be unique and imaginative, providing a delightful experience for young readers.
Make sure to only output the first page first so the user can make a choice that will affect the second page.
Add relevant emojis to each choice so the user can easily identify them.
In the "pageDescriptions" array, provide brief descriptions for all ${numberOfPages} pages upfront. These descriptions should be general enough to accommodate any choice from the previous page while maintaining story coherence.
When creating choices, ensure that while they seem different, they all plausibly lead to the next page's general description.

Example of Choices Leading to Similar Outcomes:
Page 1 Description: "Halloween night in a spooky town"
Choices:

Visit the graveyard üëª
Explore the haunted house üèöÔ∏è
Wander through the pumpkin patch üéÉ

Page 2 Description: "Encounter with a friendly ghost"
In this example, regardless of which choice is made on Page 1, the story on Page 2 involves meeting a ghost, maintaining coherence while allowing for player choice.`;
